        <p>This exercize is about JavaScript and how to get user inputs from HTML and how to use those inputs to then generate outputs for the website. 
            Here is a quick explanation of how the program works. Input 2 numerical values, X and Y. These values should not be the same. After that input a number
            in the LOOP field that will tell the program how many times it should loop and essentially it will loop from number 1 to the number you choose to input. 
            This is important since the program will check to see if for example X, is able to be divisible by the current number in the loop. If both X and Y are divisible
            the output will be Bish-Bosh, if only one number is correct the output will be Bish or Bosh respectively.</p>
